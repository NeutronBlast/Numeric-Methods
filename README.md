# Numeric methods

Various programs that model numeric methods like numeric integration, regressions, etc. The programs contained in this repository are:

1. **Newton interpolation**: First order and second order. As an input the program will ask for X, Y and XP values, the file is *difdiv.m*
2. **Polynomial interpolation**: Uses Lagrange method, the file is *lagrange.m*
3. **Exponential regression**: Applies the method and after that it will output the resulting graph, the file is *regresione.m*
4. **Polynomial regression**: Applies the method and after that it will output the resulting graph, the file is *regresionp.m*
5. **Simpson 1/3**: Applies the numeric integration method of Simpson 1/3, the file is *simpson13.m*
6. **Simpson 3/8**: Applies the numeric integration method of Simpson 3/8, the file is *simpson38.m*
7. **Trapezoidal rule**: Applies the numeric integration method of trapezoidal rule, the file is *trapecios.m*

In the *Quiz* folder there's the solution for the 3 exercises in the Quiz I did for my matlab class, you can find the questions in the PDF file
